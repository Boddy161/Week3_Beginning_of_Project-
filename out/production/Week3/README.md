## Project Information
- **Project Name:** CourseMate Connect (Tentative)

- **Project Domain:** Dating App 
  - A dating app is a mobile or web-based platform that connects individuals seeking romantic relationships. 
    Users create profiles with personal information, then browse and match with potential partners based 
    on shared interests and preferences. Messaging features facilitate communication, enabling users to arrange 
    dates and build connections.
  - What we are planning to do is create a matching app for students seeking lab partners, library friends, course mates, 
    and even mentor/mentees on their campus. The basic format will be similar to a dating app like Tinder or Soul, students
    can upload their personal profile, including information like name, age, gender, gpa,... More importantly are the courses
    they are taking this semester and what kind of relationships are they seeking. This would be easier for "lonely" students
    to find course mates easier and faster without sending extensive messages and waiting for replies on forums like 
    Piazza or Ed.
